*Welcome to my Bootstrapped Photo Grid*</center>

**About:**
This program creates an awesome photo grid effect that can be easily added to your website. The program uses jQuery and javascript to dynamically create a bootstrap container based off of the settings.json file and apply animations to each item inside the container. It produces an attractive photo grid with a collection of images located inside your website.

**Warnings:**
The Bootsrapped Photo Grid is very resource heavy especially with a lot of images. I do not recommend using more than 40 columns to display in any of the options in the settings.json file.  Less columns = Less Resources.

**Tutorial:**
Coming Soon...
